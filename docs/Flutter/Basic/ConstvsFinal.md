## Dart - Const vs Final in Dart
{: .d-inline-block }

Basic
{: .label .label-blue }

Dart provides the user to set the value of a certain variable as constants.

1. `const` keyword
2. `final` keyword


### Compare

| const        | final |
|:------------------|:------------------|
| Deeply, transitively immutable | "final" means single-assignment: a final variable or field must have an initializer. Once assigned a value, a final variable's value cannot be changed. final modifies variables.  |
|Should use at `complile time`| Should use at `runtime`|


### Example
```dart
final int age = 10;
age = 100; /// Will throw error

const String name = 'Ahihihi';
name = "Jack"; /// Will throw error as well
```
